This page presents additional analyses: IV robustness, Bajari--Ye with tender FE, year-by-year stability, FL definition variants, and network diagnostics.

## IV Robustness

### Balance Tests

Pre-determined observables are regressed on the LOO instrument with item, year, and PBU FE. All standardized differences are below 0.03$\sigma$, consistent with quasi-random FL supply variation.

### IV with Item-Group x Year FE

Adding item-group $\times$ year FE absorbs product-market-year shocks and restricts identification to within-cell variation across PBUs. This specification is reported in Appendix B as a consistency check.

### Placebo IV

Sub-threshold always-losers (firms that never win but participate below 14 tenders) are used as the instrument source. The placebo first stage is weak---an order of magnitude smaller than the main instrument---confirming that the FL screen captures a specific, not generic, bidder behavior.

---

## Bajari--Ye with Tender Fixed Effects

Re-estimating the Bajari--Ye first stage with tender $\times$ item FE absorbs all tender-level shocks (reference price, commodity prices, PBU effects). Only within-tender, cross-firm variation remains. This provides a cleaner test of bid coordination.

## Year-by-Year Stability

!!! success "Stable across time"
    The FL--price association is not driven by a particular time period. Coefficients are positive and significant in most years, with no clear trend.

## FL Definition Variants

## Network Diagnostics

### Winner HHI Distribution

### Regime Test: Bid Dispersion

The empirical bid spread distribution of FL firms matches the simulated Regime 1 (complementary cover bidding) pattern rather than Regime 2 (coordinated).
