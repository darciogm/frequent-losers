# AN-025: Cutoff-sweep robustness (FL2 through FL100)

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    Sweep the cutoff from FL2 to FL100 and watch discrimination. It traces a clean inverted-U: rising to a peak around FL13 (0.924), then sliding as the cutoff gets so high it starts excluding the cobidders themselves. The FL10–FL15 band all clears 0.90. Economically this is the reassuring picture — the signal lives on a broad plateau, so FL14 is a point on a hill, not a needle balanced on a spike.

## Question

How does cobidder AUC vary as the FL cutoff sweeps from FL2 through
FL100, and is FL14 picking up an arbitrary plateau or a peak? The
sweep documents the full robustness profile that would be hidden by
reporting only the headline FL14 number.

## Design

- **Sample**: 16,843 always-loser firms in BEC 2009–2019.
- **Positive class**: 193 cobidders ([AN-003](an-003-cade-bec-linkage.md)).
- **Sweep**: cutoff `tenders_count > k` for k ∈ {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 50, 75, 100}.
- **At each cutoff**: AUC, N firms above cutoff, N CADE cobidders above
  cutoff (the latter measures whether cobidders get "cut off" themselves
  at tighter thresholds).

## Results

Selected cutoffs from the full sweep (source CSV has 19+ rows):

| Cutoff (k) | AUC | N above cutoff | N cobidders above |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 0.730 | 9,186 | 193 |
| 5 | 0.833 | 5,757 | 193 |
| 7 | 0.868 | 4,574 | 193 |
| 10 | 0.902 | 3,442 | 193 |
| **13** (≡ paper FL14, ≥ 14) | **0.924** | **2,735** | **193** |
| 14 (≡ FL15, > 14) | 0.911 | 2,537 | 186 |
| 15 | 0.884 | 2,385 | 174 |
| 18 | 0.834 | 1,981 | 150 |
| 20 | 0.824 | 1,778 | 144 |
| 30 | 0.744 | 1,118 | (declining) |
| 50 | 0.662 | 545 | (declining) |
| 100 | 0.568 | 163 | (declining) |

![Threshold stability: AUC across 19 FL cutoffs](../assets/figures/fig_07_threshold_stability.png)

*Figure: AUC as a function of the FL cutoff value k, for cobidder
discrimination. The shape is a clean inverted U: rising from k=2 to
peak at k=13 (AUC 0.924), declining smoothly afterward. The FL10–FL15
plateau is ≥ 0.90; the FL14 paper choice sits on the high plateau,
not at a fragile peak.*

The shape is a clean **inverted U**:

- *Rising branch (k = 2 → 13)*: AUC rises monotonically from 0.730 to
  0.924. Tighter cutoffs progressively concentrate the cobidder signal.
- *Peak*: k = 13 (AUC = 0.924). This is one tender below the IQR
  threshold statistic (`\valThresholdStat` = 13.5, rounded to 14).
- *Plateau (k = 10–14)*: AUC = 0.902–0.924 across five consecutive
  cutoffs. The FL14 choice sits on the **high plateau**, not at a
  fragile peak.
- *Falling branch (k = 15 → 100)*: AUC falls from 0.884 toward 0.57 as
  the cutoff tightens past the point where cobidders themselves get
  excluded (N cobidders above cutoff drops from 193 at k=13 to 144 at
  k=20 to <50 at k=100).

## Interpretation

The sweep accomplishes three things:

1. **Plateau confirms the paper's choice is not arbitrary.** The
   median + 1.5 × IQR rule lands at k = 14 (statistic = 13.5), which is
   one bucket off the empirical AUC peak of k = 13 (0.924). The FL14
   cutoff is auditable (median + 1.5 × IQR is a textbook quantile
   rule) and sits at the top of a wide plateau. A reviewer asking
   "why this specific cutoff?" is answered: any cutoff in the FL10–
   FL15 range gives AUC > 0.90.

2. **Falling branch shows the construct has the right shape.** If the
   FL signal were spurious, tighter cutoffs would not produce
   monotonically smaller AUC after the peak. The clean inverted-U is
   what one would expect under the loser-side cover-bidding
   interpretation: too-loose cutoffs include many non-cobidder
   always-losers (false positives); too-tight cutoffs exclude the
   cobidders themselves (false negatives at the construct level — the
   N cobidders above cutoff column shows this directly).

3. **FL14 (≥ 14) is administrative, not a structural optimum.** Because
   the sweep indexes cutoffs as `> k`, the paper's ≥ 14 rule is the `> 13`
   row: AUC 0.924, 2,735 firms, 193 cobidders — matching the headline
   AUC in [AN-004](an-004-cobidder-baseline.md). It happens to sit near
   the top of the plateau, but the paper does **not** select FL14 because
   it is the AUC peak — it is fixed *ex ante* by the median + 1.5·IQR
   administrative rule. The economic object is the continuous loser-side
   rank ([AN-011](an-011-horse-race-continuous.md),
   [AN-023](an-023-theory-operationalization-audit.md)); FL14 is the
   auditable deployable layer on top of it. The sweep is a robustness
   frontier, not a search for an optimal cutoff.

This is the robustness check that converts H1 from "single-cutoff
result" to "robust across a wide cutoff band". See
[H:cobidder-concentration](../hypotheses/cobidder-concentration.md).

## Follow-ups

- Same sweep on temporal-holdout sample (the inverted U should retain
  shape but with depressed levels — interaction with
  [AN-013](an-013-precision-at-k-audit.md)).
- Sweep on the strict-train pool of
  [AN-006](an-006-strict-prospective-holdout.md).
- Add macros `\valAUCSweepK10`, `\valAUCSweepK13`, `\valAUCSweepK14`,
  `\valAUCSweepK20` to the `scripts/99_make_paper_values.R` pipeline so
  that the sweep numbers enter values.tex on the next refresh.
