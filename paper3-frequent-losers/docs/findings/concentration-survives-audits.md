# Exposure explains the ranking — no robust residual survives the audits

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    The natural skeptic's reply is "of course cartel-linked firms score high — they bid a lot, and your score just counts bids." The audits stress-test exactly that: strip out raw bidding volume, hold opportunity fixed, and ask the permutations whether anything is left. The answer under the reproducible non-circular label is: essentially nothing. Within a fixed opportunity stratum the ranking is at chance, and the marginal nested increment fails the permutation tests. The honest reading is that exposure — mechanical, anchor-agnostic co-participation — explains the concentration, not a residual loss-intensity signal.

🟡 Under the reproducible non-circular label (651 always-loser
cobidders), the audit disciplines of §4.2 of the
[manuscript](../paper.md) **deflate** the residual signal from
[the cobidder concentration finding](cobidders-concentrated-in-fl-stratum.md)
to nothing robust. Each audit strips a cheap mechanical explanation; once
opportunity is held fixed, **no robust residual ordering survives net of
opportunity** — the within-stratum AUC is at chance, the matched
permutation is non-significant, and the FL-enrichment is non-significant.

1. **Opportunity discipline** ([AN-005](../analyses/an-005-sham-fl-permutation.md)).
   Holding participation fixed via opportunity-cell permutation and
   matched-stratum comparison, the within-stratum loss-intensity score is
   at **chance (ROC 0.471; FL14 0.507)**. The nested increment over the
   exposure-only benchmark is **+0.010 (DeLong p = 0.013)** — marginal at
   best, and **not robust across designs**: matched-stratum label
   permutation gives p = 0.127 (ns) and FL-enrichment within matched
   strata gives p = 0.067 (ns). Negative controls corroborate the
   opportunity account: a real-vs-placebo comparison is statistically
   indistinguishable (p = 0.46), and a high-volume-winner null sits
   *above* the real signal (p = 0.91). Most of the raw lift *is*
   opportunity, and what is left does not survive permutation.

2. **Leakage discipline** ([AN-014](../analyses/an-014-leakage-audit-d3.md)).
   The in-sample item-level numbers attenuate sharply under out-of-fold
   CV at firm level and then under temporal holdout. The attenuation is
   **honest, not a triumph**: under the broad label the disciplined
   numbers leave no robust residual ordering. Direct-defendant AUC stays
   near random (0.49–0.51) in every scenario.

3. **Timing discipline** ([AN-006](../analyses/an-006-strict-prospective-holdout.md),
   [AN-013](../analyses/an-013-precision-at-k-audit.md)). Strict ex ante
   ranking (score formed on 2009–2016 only) **fails on the full universe**
   (ROC 0.474, below chance; precision@500 = recall@500 = 0). A residue
   survives only inside the training always-loser pool (continuous ROC
   0.684; FL14 binary 0.646), i.e., among incumbents the labels
   retrospectively anchor — not as a prospective screen.

4. **Clustered randomization inference** ([AN-013](../analyses/an-013-precision-at-k-audit.md)).
   Clustering the null at the item-group × year level (B = 1,000), the
   ROC, PR, and prec@500 p-values are ≈ 0.001 but **case-coverage breadth
   is not significant (p = 0.103)** — the concentration is real but not
   broad-based across cases.

5. **Anchor-agnostic armor battery** (`outputs/diagnostics/audit_armor/`).
   The deflationary verdict is decided here, not by "exposure beats the
   score". Genuine **label-blind opportunity ranks the label at only 0.553**
   (ranking by *observed* contact reaches 0.905, but that is mechanical
   label encoding). A planted **positive control recovers within-stratum
   AUC 0.953**, so the within-stratum test is not dead by construction; the
   **permutation test has power 0.97 at within-AUC 0.55**, bounding any
   residual below ≈ 0.55; and a **label-frozen timing** benchmark
   (prospective 0.713 ≈ retrospective 0.718) shows generic contact
   forecasting, not cartel-specific prediction.

The audited (not the in-sample) numbers are what the cost-of-evidence
architecture of §6 must rely on, and they do not support a residual
loss-intensity claim.

**Caveat.** The surviving residual is at chance and the permutations are
non-significant. The reading is 🟡 — single-source on BEC — and the
deflationary decomposition itself is the contribution, not a screen that
works.
