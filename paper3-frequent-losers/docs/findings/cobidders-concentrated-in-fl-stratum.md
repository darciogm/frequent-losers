!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    A bid-rigging ring needs losers: someone has to submit losing bids so the auction looks competitive while the pre-chosen firm wins. Those firms leave a footprint — they show up over and over and never win. So when we rank firms purely by how persistently they lose, the firms that bid next to convicted cartelists rise toward the top. But almost all of that lift is simply *opportunity*: firms that bid a lot have more chances to sit next to anyone. Once you hold opportunity fixed and ask whether *losing intensity* adds anything beyond raw exposure, essentially nothing survives — the within-comparison ordering is at chance. The honest finding is that the raw concentration is mechanical, anchor-agnostic co-participation exposure, not a residual cartel signal.

🟡 In São Paulo's BEC procurement platform (2009–2019), the
frequent-loser ranking concentrates **adjudication-anchored cobidders**
inside the always-loser stratum. The canonical validation label is the
**651 always-loser cobidders** — unique always-loser firms that share at
least one BEC tender-item with a BEC-active direct CADE defendant; direct
defendants are excluded and the frequent-loser flag is **never used to
construct the label** (composition: 341 FL14 / 310 non-FL). "Cobidder"
denotes adjudication-anchored exposure, never membership. The raw ranking
separates them (ROC 0.761, lift@500 ≈ 5.6×), but that separation is
almost entirely *opportunity*.

**The decomposition is the finding.** Ranking firms by *observed* contact
reaches **ROC ≈ 0.90**, but that figure is **mechanical label encoding** —
a cobidder *is*, by construction, a firm with positive contact — reported
only to expose inflation, not a competing model. The honest, genuinely
**label-blind opportunity benchmark is ROC ≈ 0.553**
([AN-004](../analyses/an-004-cobidder-baseline.md); armor pack). Once we
condition on opportunity (a within-stratum comparison that holds
participation fixed),
the loss-intensity score retains only **ROC = 0.471 — indistinguishable
from chance** (FL14 within-stratum 0.507), and the nested increment of
the score over exposure alone is **+0.010** (DeLong p = 0.013;
[AN-011](../analyses/an-011-horse-race-continuous.md)). That marginal
positive does not survive the permutation designs: matched-stratum label
permutation gives p = 0.127 (ns), and FL-enrichment within matched strata
gives p = 0.067 (ns). **There is no robust residual signal net of
opportunity.**

FL14 *enrichment* is descriptive and real at the unconditional level —
P(cobidder | FL14) = 12.5% vs 2.2% for non-FL always-losers (≈5.7×) — but
this enrichment is mechanical, anchor-agnostic co-participation exposure
and is **not significant within matched opportunity strata** (p = 0.067). The
concentration is what motivates the sequential architecture: the cheap
award layer **concentrates forensic priority** for where to start the
costly bid-recovery stage — it does not identify cartelists.

**Caveat.** The cobidder set (651 firms) is defined relative to
CADE-adjudicated cartel environments in 2009–2019; the scope is tied to
adjudication coverage rather than to a universal cartel population. The
reading is 🟡 because the within-stratum residual is at chance, the
permutation and enrichment tests are non-significant, and the result is
single-source on BEC. An anchor-agnostic armor battery confirms the
verdict is not an artifact: a planted positive control ($O_i$) recovers
within-stratum AUC 0.953 (so the test is not dead by construction) and the
permutation test has power 0.97 at within-AUC 0.55, bounding any residual
below ≈ 0.55. Negative controls corroborate the opportunity
account (real ≈ placebo, p = 0.46; high-volume-winner null *above* real,
p = 0.91;
[AN-005](../analyses/an-005-sham-fl-permutation.md),
[AN-006](../analyses/an-006-strict-prospective-holdout.md),
[AN-013](../analyses/an-013-precision-at-k-audit.md),
[AN-014](../analyses/an-014-leakage-audit-d3.md)). The null against direct
defendants ([AN-007](../analyses/an-007-auc-direct-cade.md)) is the
predicted scope boundary.
