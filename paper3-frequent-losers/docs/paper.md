## Contribution

The paper makes three contributions:

1. **Participation-based screen.** We introduce a screen that runs on win/loss records alone---no bid microdata, no enforcement priors, no supervised training---and can be deployed by any procurement agency that records who bid and who won. Against competition-authority convictions, the screen achieves AUC $= 0.94$, flags environments with 3.6--7.7% higher conditional prices, and complements bid-level tools that capture different collusion signatures (correlation 0.06).

2. **Five supporting diagnostics.** Bajari--Ye bid-coordination tests, network-split heterogeneity, regime selection, dyadic linkage, and minimum-bidder constraint variation are jointly consistent with coordinated cover bidding.

3. **Institutional tie-in.** The price association concentrates where cover bidding is a strategic choice (7.6% voluntary premium) and where oversight is weakest (12.5x gradient across purchasing-unit size quartiles), tying the screen's empirical performance to the institutional features that make cover bidding profitable.

**Non-claims.** The conditional price association is not a causal estimate of the effect of collusion on prices; the FL classification flags suspicious environments, not guilty firms; and the diagnostics, while consistent with coordinated cover bidding, fall short of sanction-grade evidence. What the paper contributes is the screen itself---how to build it, how it performs against external enforcement data, and why the diagnostic pattern supports its use as a first-stage investigative tool.

## Institutional Background

### BEC Platform

The **Bolsa Eletronica de Compras (BEC)** is Sao Paulo state's centralized electronic procurement platform, used by 1,308 public buying units (PBUs) from 2009 to 2019.

Two procurement modalities are relevant:

| Modality | Format | Key Feature |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Convite** | Sealed-bid | Requires minimum 3 bidders (Lei 8.666/93); threshold R\$ 80,000 |
| **Pregao** | Electronic reverse auction | Standard modality; no bidder minimum; real-time bids |

### Cover Bidding Incentives

- **Convite**: the 3-bidder minimum creates direct demand for cover bidders---a cartel with fewer than 3 members needs cover bidders to meet the quorum rule. The constraint forces some participation regardless of market conditions, **diluting** the FL signal (3.8% price association).
- **Pregao**: no minimum-bidder rule means cover bidding is purely voluntary. The FL screen picks it up more cleanly (**9.3% price association**)---larger where cover bidding is a strategic choice rather than rule compliance.

### Lei 14.133/2021

Brazil's new procurement law eliminates the convite modality and with it the minimum-bidder rule. Two testable predictions follow: the constraint-binding channel ($\hat{\beta}_{\text{FL} \times (n<3)} = -0.160$) should disappear; the voluntary channel (7.6% premium where $n \geq 3$) should survive.

## FL Definition (Two-Step)

### Sample

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Source** | BEC (Sao Paulo, 2009--2019) |
| **Tender-items** | 4.5 million (raw); 1,654,447 (analysis sample; 1,654,401 for price regressions) |
| **Bids** | 40 million (bid-level) |
| **Firms** | 41,000 total; 16,843 always-losers |
| **PBUs** | 1,308 public buying units |
| **Item types** | 18,783 |

### Step 1 --- Always-losers

16,843 firms with win rate = 0 across all 2009--2019 tenders. The zero-win condition is strict: relaxing it to 1% or 2% attenuates the coefficient substantially, so the bright line at zero is doing real work.

### Step 2 --- IQR threshold

Among always-losers, compute median + 1.5 $\times$ IQR of participation counts $\approx$ 14 tenders. Firms above this threshold are classified as FL.

**Result:** **2,735 FL firms** (16.2% of always-losers).

!!! note "Treatment variable"
    `losers = 1` if a tender-item has at least one FL participant. FL presence occurs in 4.8% of analysis-sample tenders.

## Conceptual Framework

The framework organizes the screening intuition and generates five diagnostic implications. Full assumptions, proofs, and the structural likelihood are in the Appendix.

A cartel controls a designated winner and deploys $m \geq 0$ cover bidders (FL firms), each bidding above the winning bid $b^*$. The optimal $m^*$ falls with detection probability $\theta_k$ and per-bidder cost $c_1$. Under convite, the minimum-bidder rule ($\underline{n} = 3$) can force participation, mixing mandatory and voluntary deployments and diluting the FL--price signal.

### Two Regimes of Cover Bidding

| | Regime 1: Complementary | Regime 2: Coordinated |
|---|---|---|
| **Bid distribution** | $U[\bar{b}, \bar{b}+\delta]$ (wide, above winner) | $N(\mu_c, \sigma_c^2)$ (tight, near winner) |
| **Coordination** | Minimal (just "show up and lose") | Precise calibration required |
| **Testable signature** | Wide FL bid dispersion | Narrow FL bid dispersion |
| **Dispersion screens** | Effective | Lose power |

!!! danger "Regime 2 is empirically dominant"
    BIC strongly favors Regime 2 ($\Delta$BIC = $-91{,}473$). FL bids are 28% **less** dispersed than non-FL bids ($\hat{\sigma}_c / \hat{\sigma}_g = 0.72$), rendering dispersion-based screens ineffective. A participation-based screen sidesteps this problem---it does not care how cover bids are distributed, only that cover bidders must show up.

### Strategic Complementarity ($\gamma > 0$)

The model permits strategic complementarity: if the marginal return to cover bidding is higher in competitive tenders (many genuine bidders), then $m^*$ *increases* in $n$. The calibrated model confirms this pattern ($\hat{\gamma} = 0.69 > 0$): cartels deploy more cover bidders precisely where genuine competition is strongest.

### Five Diagnostic Implications

| # | Diagnostic implication | Empirical test | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | FL associated with higher prices | Conditional price comparison | Results |
| D2 | FL adds to, not displaces, genuine bidders | Non-FL bidder count | Results |
| D3 | Coordinated regime: $\sigma_c < \sigma_g$ | BIC model selection | Structural |
| D4 | FL association decreases in HHI | Network split | Results |
| D5 | FL residuals non-exchangeable | Bajari--Ye KS + pairwise | Results |

## Empirical Strategy

The empirical strategy operates in three tiers: price association, detection performance, and supporting diagnostics.

### Tier 1: Conditional Price Comparison

$$y_{igt} = \beta \cdot \text{losers}_{igt} + \mathbf{x}_{igt}' \boldsymbol{\delta} + \alpha_g + \lambda_t + \gamma_k + \varepsilon_{igt}$$

where $y_{igt}$ is the outcome for tender-item $i$ in item group $g$ at time $t$ and purchasing unit $k$; $\alpha_g$, $\lambda_t$, $\gamma_k$ are item, year, and PBU fixed effects; errors clustered at item level.

**Four specifications:** (1) item + year FE, (2) + PBU FE, (3) pregao only, (4) convite only.

**Four DVs:** log negotiated price, log firms, log bids, log non-FL firms.

**Matching:** CEM (0.077, $N = 969{,}751$) and IPW (0.055, $N = 830{,}194$) bracket the OLS and cross-fit estimates.

### Tier 2: Detection Performance

ROC analysis against CADE cartel co-participation. AUC = 0.94, Youden $J = 0.84$ at 1.45x IQR. Horse-race regression against Imhof-style CV proxy.

### Tier 3: Supporting Diagnostics

- **Network-split heterogeneity:** competitive vs. concentrated markets
- **Bajari--Ye tests:** exchangeability and conditional independence of bid residuals
- **Structural estimation:** BIC model selection between Regime 1 and Regime 2
- **Dyadic linkage:** stratified permutation test on FL--winner pair frequency
- **Minimum-bidder constraint variation:** voluntary vs. forced cover bidding

### Measurement-Error Diagnostic (IV)

$$Z_{kgt} = \sum_{j \neq k} \mathbf{1}[\text{FL firm active at PBU } j \text{ in group } g, \text{ year } t]$$

The **leave-one-out instrument** counts FL firms active at *other* PBUs in the same product market and year. The IV estimate (0.194, $F = 396$) exceeds OLS by a factor of three, consistent with attenuation in the binary FL indicator. Exclusion-restriction concerns keep it off the primary range---it is reported as a measurement-error diagnostic, not a preferred estimate.
