## Abstract

Minimum-bidder rules in public procurement give cartels a reason to
deploy cover bidders---firms that show up repeatedly with no
intention of winning. We exploit this behavioral footprint to build
a participation-based screen: *frequent losers* (FL), firms
that never win yet bid abnormally often. The screen requires only
win/loss records, making it deployable in settings where bid
microdata are unavailable. In Sao Paulo's electronic procurement
(4.5 million tender-items, 2009--2019), it achieves
AUC $= 0.94$ against competition-authority convictions, complements
bid-level tools (correlation 0.06), and flags environments with
3.6--7.7% higher conditional prices. The price association is
concentrated in competitive markets and where cover bidding is
voluntary rather than forced by the minimum-bidder
constraint---suggesting strategic deployment, not mere rule
compliance. We propose a three-stage enforcement pathway (screen,
triage, investigate) that allocates investigative resources toward
the procurement environments where the association is strongest and
oversight weakest.

## Key Findings

!!! success "3.6--7.7% conditional price association"
    FL-present tenders exhibit **3.6--7.7% higher conditional prices** across four estimation approaches: cross-fit (3.6%), IPW (5.5%), OLS with item + year + PBU FE (6.4%), and CEM matching (7.7%). The estimates cluster rather than scatter, indicating a stable association across designs.

!!! warning "AUC = 0.94 against CADE convictions"
    The FL screen achieves **AUC = 0.94** against competition-authority convictions, versus 0.79 for an Imhof-style bid-level proxy. FL firms co-participate with convicted cartelists at **3.5 times** the baseline rate ($p < 0.001$). The two screens capture largely non-overlapping information (correlation 0.06); naively combining them into a single score degrades detection to AUC = 0.61, confirming that they operate on different dimensions and are best deployed sequentially.

!!! danger "Coordinated cover bidding (Regime 2)"
    BIC strongly favors coordinated cover bidding ($\Delta$BIC = $-91{,}473$): FL bids are 28% **less** dispersed than non-FL bids ($\sigma_c / \sigma_g = 0.72$). The price association concentrates in **competitive markets** (0.126) and vanishes in concentrated ones ($-0.018$), consistent with strategic complementarity ($\hat{\gamma} = 0.69 > 0$).

!!! info "Three-stage enforcement pathway"
    The FL screen requires only **participation and outcome data** (no bid values). We propose a screen--triage--investigate pathway that exploits a **12.5x gradient** in the FL--price association across PBU size quartiles to direct investigative resources where oversight is weakest.
