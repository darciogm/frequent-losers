!!! info "Interpretation"
    Administrative purchases carry **lower** reference prices than ordinary purchases (-9.1%, p < 0.10), a striking contrast with litigated purchases which carry +7.6% higher prices. Most other effects are imprecisely estimated. This confirms that administrative purchases occupy an **intermediate position**: they share urgency constraints but lack the price-inflating effects of judicial sanctions.

|---------|:------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:-----------------:|
| Ref. Price | +2.7%* | +7.6%** | **-9.1%*** | -27.3%*** |
| Neg. Price (Total) | +5.4%*** | +9.1%*** | -6.0% | -30.0%** |

!!! success "Key Takeaway"
    The gradient of effects across comparison groups—largest for litigated vs ordinary, moderate for urgent (pooled), and **reversed** for admin vs ordinary—confirms that **judicial sanctions, not urgency per se**, drive the procurement cost premium.
