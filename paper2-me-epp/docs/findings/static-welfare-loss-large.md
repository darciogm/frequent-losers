# Static welfare cost of full set-aside is ~28.9% of open-regime price (non-pharma)

🟡 The full SME-only set-aside generates a static welfare loss of
**~28.9% of the open-regime price $p^{S_1}$** in standardized
non-pharmaceutical procurement at &lambda;=0.30
([AN-011](../analyses/an-011-welfare-arithmetic.md)). The loss
combines real allocative waste (DWL$_{\mathrm{alloc}}$ — the contract is
assigned to a higher-cost supplier) with the fiscal distortion from
financing the increased payment ($\lambda \cdot \Delta_{\mathrm{gov}}$
at the Ballard-Shoven-Whalley benchmark). Translated to public-finance
units on Group 65 alone, the welfare cost spans
**R$55–128 million per year** (US$16–37M), depending on the SME-eligible
adherence rate. This is one product group of São Paulo's R$13 billion
procurement platform.

The implied SME welfare weight required for a planner to prefer the
full set-aside over open auctions is ~2.42 in non-pharma — a planner
must value SME producer surplus at $2.42 of welfare for the
exclusionary regime to be rationalized as optimal
(see [Implied welfare weight](../hypotheses/implied-welfare-weight-large.md)).

**Caveat.** The welfare arithmetic inherits the maintained IPV-clock
restriction
([H:ipv-clock-admissible](../hypotheses/ipv-clock-admissible.md)). The
loss number is *static* — it holds entry and recovered willingness-to-supply
primitives fixed; it does not solve a counterfactual legal regime in
equilibrium. The pharma analog is 44.8% but more model-sensitive
([AN-016](../analyses/an-016-pharma-boundary.md)); pharma is treated as
a boundary case, not a second headline. The &lambda;=0.30 baseline is
the Ballard-Shoven-Whalley convention; the implied weight scales
inversely with &lambda;.
