# The protected SME pool responds but does not replace lost discipline

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    This is not a story where SMEs simply fail to show up. After the set-aside
    returns, the number of SME bidders per auction roughly doubles — the protected
    pool does respond. The problem is the quality of competition, not the
    headcount: even with twice as many SMEs bidding, the winning price stays above
    the open-auction benchmark. More of the protected type cannot replicate the
    discipline of the type you excluded.

🟡 After the March 2018 SME-only cutoff, the number of SME bidders per
auction roughly doubles in switched group 65 — the protected pool does
respond. But the realized post-policy price $S_3$ remains above the
open benchmark $S_1$ ([AN-010](../analyses/an-010-bne-decomposition.md)).
The set-aside cannot be rationalized as a *mechanical non-entry* story:
SMEs show up; the issue is that the protected pool's cost distribution
cannot recreate the competitive discipline supplied by the excluded
non-SMEs.

The structural decomposition splits the protected-pool offset
$S_3 - S_2$ into a participation channel (more SMEs) and a
composition-of-active-SMEs channel (the active SME cost distribution
may itself shift under the policy — selection, sourcing or technology
changes, product-mix changes). The offset is sizable but does not
flip the net price effect from positive to negative — the net
$S_3 - S_1$ remains positive in both non-pharma and pharma cells.

**Caveat.** The interpretation that the SME pool *cannot* recreate the
discipline rests on the maintained IPV-clock reading
([H:ipv-clock-admissible](../hypotheses/ipv-clock-admissible.md)): the
post-policy SME drop-outs are read as cost observations. The threat
that drop-outs are strategically suppressed (more cover-bidding among
the smaller eligible pool) is now bounded by the collusion screens
([AN-015](../analyses/an-015-collusion-screens.md)): Conley close-pair
shares are flat or falling post-cutoff and Bajari-Ye T1 ratios fall in
both classes — the differential-coordination shock that would explain
the protected-pool offset away is rejected. Residual baseline clustering
(real > null in every cell) remains a limitation, hence 🟡.
