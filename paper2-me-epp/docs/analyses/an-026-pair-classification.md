question: Does a persistent-pair coordination screen conditional on CADMAT product class detect within-class bidder coordination, and does the persistent-pairing signature (count of firm pairs co-bidding in ≥5 auctions) survive class conditioning?

headline: "Within-class permutation null rejects on raw pair-count statistics (T_1 max count and T_2 99th percentile, p<0.001 in all 4 cells) — bidders do cluster more than random within class. But the persistent-pairing signature T_3 (count of pairs co-bidding in ≥5 auctions) is consistent with the null in all 4 cells (p ∈ [0.730, 1.000]) once CADMAT class is controlled — the 'persistent meeting' pattern is segmentation, not coordination. Result is stable pre vs post the March 2018 cutoff."

# AN-026: Persistent-pair coordination screen, class-conditional

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    Another collusion check: do the same pairs of firms keep meeting more than chance, once you condition on product class? Raw clustering rejects randomness, but conditioning on CADMAT class makes the 'persistent meeting' pattern disappear — it is market segmentation (firms specialize in product lines), not coordination. Stable before and after the policy.

## Question

The Bajari-Ye T1 screen in [AN-015](an-015-collusion-screens.md)
detects raw pair-coordination clustering — observed counts of frequent
co-bidding pairs exceed a permutation null. A natural question:
how much of that clustering is *bidder coordination* vs *market
segmentation* (the same firms repeatedly meet because they specialize
in the same CADMAT product class)? A *class-conditional* permutation
null answers this directly: shuffle firm labels *within* CADMAT class,
breaking firm-auction associations within class while preserving
class-level firm-bid counts. The residual clustering after class
conditioning is what bears on coordination.

## Design

- **Sample**: BEC Pregão bid logs spanning March 2018; firms with
  ≥5 bids in the stratum; CADMAT product class as conditioning
  variable; 4 cells (non-pharma / pharma × pre / post).
- **Variation**: persistent-pair clustering relative to a
  class-conditional permutation null.
- **Specification**: $B = 200$ permutation replicates. Three test
  statistics:
  - $T_1$: max pair co-bidding count in the stratum.
  - $T_2$: 99th percentile of the pair co-bidding distribution.
  - $T_3$: count of firm pairs co-bidding in ≥5 auctions
    ("persistent pairs").
- **Outcomes**: observed statistic, class-conditional null mean,
  one-sided $p$-value.

## Results

**Persistent-pair screen, class-conditional null**
(`tab_collusion_screen_pair_classcond.tex`):

| Stratum | $N_{\mathrm{cls}}$ | $T_1$ obs | $T_1$ null | $T_1$ $p$ | $T_2$ obs | $T_2$ null | $T_2$ $p$ | $T_3$ obs | $T_3$ null | $T_3$ $p$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Non-pharma Pre  | 47 | 1220 | 769.4 | **<0.001** | 131.4 | 60.5 | **<0.001** | 5733 | 6057.3 | 1.000 |
| Non-pharma Post | 47 | 1059 | 871.8 | **<0.001** | 102.0 | 52.3 | **<0.001** | 6048 | 6071.1 | 0.730 |
| Pharma Pre      | 2 | 1428 | 1104.1 | **<0.001** | 606.1 | 328.3 | **<0.001** | 2294 | 3070.4 | 1.000 |
| Pharma Post     | 3 | 1100 | 1005.2 | **<0.001** | 312.1 | 164.8 | **<0.001** | 2676 | 3170.9 | 1.000 |

Output: `v7-jpube-tight/output/tables/tab_collusion_screen_pair_classcond.tex`.

## Interpretation

**$T_1$ and $T_2$ reject the class-conditional null in every cell.**
The maximum pair co-bidding count and the 99th-percentile of the
distribution both exceed the within-class permutation null at
$p<0.001$. There IS pair-clustering beyond what within-class random
shuffling produces.

**$T_3$ does NOT reject in any cell.** The "persistent pair"
signature — firm pairs co-bidding in ≥5 auctions — sits *at or below*
the class-conditional null mean in all 4 cells:
- Non-pharma Pre: 5733 observed vs 6057.3 null (obs *below* null;
  $p = 1.000$).
- Non-pharma Post: 6048 vs 6071.1 ($p = 0.730$).
- Pharma Pre: 2294 vs 3070.4 (obs well below null; $p = 1.000$).
- Pharma Post: 2676 vs 3170.9 ($p = 1.000$).

**Reading.** The raw $T_1$ / $T_2$ clustering picked up by the
unconditional Bajari-Ye in [AN-015](an-015-collusion-screens.md)
*partly* survives class conditioning — there is real within-class
clustering. But the *persistent-meeting* signature ($T_3$) is fully
absorbed by class segmentation: firms repeatedly co-bid because they
specialize in the same CADMAT class, not because they coordinate.

**Cross-period stability.** This is the load-bearing reading for
[H:no-collusion-confound](../hypotheses/no-collusion-confound.md):
the $T_3$ result is invariant across the policy break. Non-pharma:
5733 → 6048; pharma: 2294 → 2676 — increases in both cells, but
within the null distribution in both. Whatever "coordination" is
present is *stable* across the cutoff — not generated by the policy
shock.

**Caveat — pharma cell sizes.** Pharma has $N_{\mathrm{cls}} = 2$
(pre) and 3 (post) — very small number of conditioning classes. The
within-class permutation has limited variation in pharma; conclusions
in pharma are weaker than in non-pharma.

Confidence: **yellow.** The class-conditional test is informative
beyond the unconditional Bajari-Ye — it isolates segmentation from
coordination, and the persistent-pairing signature dissolves under
conditioning. The yellow caveat is the small pharma cell ($N=2$ or 3
classes) and the absence of a within-firm coordination test (which
would require strategic-bid-level analysis, not just pair counts).

## Follow-ups

- **Schurter test as separate AN**: the third leg of the screen
  battery (`v7-jpube-tight/scripts/59_collusion_screen_schurter.R`)
  is reported only in aggregate in [AN-015](an-015-collusion-screens.md);
  a separate AN would document its test-statistic distribution.
- **Anchor variant**: `tab_collusion_screen_anchor.tex` reports a
  pair-anchored variant that ties pairs to specific reference
  firms — useful for identifying *which* firms drive the
  unconditional $T_1$ rejection.
- **Pharma class expansion**: re-run with finer pharma sub-classes
  (drug therapeutic class) to expand $N_{\mathrm{cls}}$ in pharma
  and tighten inference.
