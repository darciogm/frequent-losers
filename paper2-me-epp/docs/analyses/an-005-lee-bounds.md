# AN-005: Lee bounds on the DiDiR price coefficient

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    Different auctions complete under the two regimes, so maybe selection — not price formation — drives the result. Lee bounds draw a worst-case box around that concern. The box is tiny here (−0.131 to −0.123), so differential completion cannot explain away the price effect.

!!! info "Reduced-form motivation layer"
    The numbers below are from the v1–v4 reduced-form DiDiR pipeline
    (`scripts/02_analysis.R` + companions), which the v8 manuscript
    carries as **motivation** in §1 but does not headline. The canonical
    v8 result is the structural counterfactual decomposition — see
    [AN-010](an-010-bne-decomposition.md) (decomposition) and
    [AN-011](an-011-welfare-arithmetic.md) (welfare arithmetic).

## Question

The price and distance regressions condition on completion (i.e., the
item was successfully procured). If the treatment shifts completion
rates, the conditional coefficient confounds the policy effect with
differential selection into the sample. Lee (2009) bounds correct for
this by trimming the outcome distribution in the *excess-selected* cell.

## Design

- **Sample**: 18-month window; both completed and non-completed items
  (completion indicator from `oc_item_status`).
- **Variation**: same DiDiR as [AN-001](an-001-didir-prices.md).
- **Specification**: Lee (2009) trimming bounds — the conditional
  outcome distribution in the cell with the higher completion rate is
  trimmed at the proportion required to match the lower-completion
  cell, producing tight bounds on the conditional coefficient.
- **Outcomes**: log prices, distance.

## Results

| Outcome | Lower bound | Upper bound | Trimming proportion |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Log prices | −0.1306*** (0.0096) | −0.1227*** (0.0085) | (see note) |
| Distance (km) | +10.775*** (2.232) | +10.804*** (2.233) | 8.82% |

*Item-clustered SE. \*\*\* p<0.01.*

Output: `output/tables/tab_lee_bounds.tex`.

## Interpretation

The bounds on log prices are tight: a gap of ~0.008 between lower and
upper endpoints, well below the standard error of the point estimate.
Both endpoints reject zero at p<0.01. Sample selection through
differential completion has *negligible* impact on the price
coefficient.

The distance bounds are essentially identical at both endpoints
(+10.78 vs +10.80 km), with an 8.82% trimming proportion. The
distance estimate is therefore *not* driven by selection on completion.

Confidence: **yellow.** The Lee bounds discipline the
selection-on-completion margin; they do not address other identification
threats (parallel trends, cost shocks). The full identification battery
is in [AN-004](an-004-placebo-tests.md), [AN-005](an-005-lee-bounds.md),
[AN-006](an-006-honestdid.md). The reading is yellow because all three
are own-project robustness checks rather than independent replications.

## Follow-ups

- Composition-margin Lee bound: extend the trimming logic to the
  SME-winner indicator
  ([AN-009](an-009-sme-winner-extensions.md)) to bound the
  composition-shift coefficient against differential completion.
- Two-margin selection: completion *and* item-attribute coverage may
  both be selective. A joint selection model (or a Heckman two-step)
  would extend the Lee bound; not in scope for the current paper.
