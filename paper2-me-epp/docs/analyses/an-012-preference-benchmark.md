# AN-012: 10% SME price preference benchmark

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    What if, instead of banning non-SMEs, you give SMEs a 10% bid discount for winner selection? Everyone still competes, so the simulated price barely moves — yet SMEs win more often. The preference buys redistribution without sacrificing price discipline; it is a static design benchmark, not a forecast of a specific legal regime.

## Question

A static price preference is a non-exclusionary design alternative to
a set-aside: SMEs receive a percentage haircut to their bids for
*winner selection only*, but all firms remain eligible to participate
and the government pays the actual winning bid. What is the simulated
price effect of a 10% SME preference, and how much SME win-rate gain
does it deliver?

## Design

- **Sample**: structural cells from
  [AN-010](an-010-bne-decomposition.md).
- **Variation**: counterfactual policy regime $V_3$ (10% SME price
  preference for selection) vs $S_1$ (open).
- **Specification**: BNE simulation; SME bid is multiplied by 0.90 for
  selection only; the government pays the actual (unhaircut) winning
  bid.
- **Outcomes**: $\Delta p = p^{V_3} - p^{S_1}$ (simulated price shift);
  SME win-rate gain.

## Results

From `v8-jpube/output/values.tex` (10% SME price preference for
selection only; government pays actual winning bid; entry held fixed):

| Class | $\Delta p$ vs $S_1$ | SME win-rate gain |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Non-pharma** | **−0.004** | **+4.3 pp** |
| Pharma | +0.002 | +1.4 pp |

Both price shifts are essentially zero in reference-price units —
non-SMEs continue to bid and discipline the price-forming order
statistic. The SME win-rate gain is smaller than under full set-aside
(which delivers full SME-winner concentration by construction); the
preference trades redistribution for preserved competitive discipline.

Output: macros in `v8-jpube/output/values.tex`; paper table
`tab_welfare_policy_v8` columns 5–6 in §5.

## Entry-response bound on the welfare ranking

The static comparison holds entry fixed. The legal shock does not
identify entry costs, so instead of a free-entry counterfactual the
paper *bounds* the welfare ranking $V_3 \succ V_0$ (10% preference vs
full set-aside). The worst case for $V_3$ runs through non-SMEs: the
preference handicaps them, so they may enter less and weaken the very
discipline that makes $V_3$ cheap. Non-SME participation under $V_3$ is
scaled to $\phi$ times its open-auction rate ($\phi \in [0,1]$, with
$\phi = 1$ the no-response case used in the main text), while SME entry
is held conservatively at its pre-policy rate (a real preference would
raise it, which only helps $V_3$).

From §6.4 of the paper and Online Appendix OA-E (Table OA-3,
`v8-jpube/output/values_entry_bound.tex`):

- **Non-pharma**: the $V_3 \succ V_0$ ranking survives until the
  preference drives out **~90% of non-SME entrants** ($\phi \approx
  0.10$) — participation collapsing from **2.68** to about **a quarter
  of a bidder per auction**.
- **Pharma**: the ranking survives even the **complete removal of
  non-SME entry** (the full set-aside is so costly there).
- Letting SME entry *respond* (which a real preference would induce)
  only **widens** $V_3$'s margin in both classes.

This is a *bound*, not a free-entry counterfactual — entry costs are
not identified. But it shows the near-zero static cost result is not an
artifact of the fixed-entry assumption: the preference's advantage
survives extreme non-SME discouragement before the ranking could flip.

## Interpretation

The 10% preference preserves the price-forming pool: non-SMEs continue
to bid and discipline the price-forming order statistic. The
simulated price is essentially unchanged from $S_1$. The preference
*is* a redistribution device — SMEs win more often than under open
competition — but the redistribution is smaller than under the full
set-aside.

The reading is that the **relevant policy frontier** is not "support
SMEs vs do nothing" but "exclusionary redistribution vs support that
preserves the price-forming bidder pool". The 10% preference is a
*static design benchmark* of the second branch, not a forecast of a
legal preference regime.

Confidence: **yellow.** The simulation holds entry fixed at the
pre-policy level by construction — an entry-elastic version would
require a separate entry model. The entry-response bound above shows
the $V_3 \succ V_0$ ranking is robust to extreme non-SME discouragement
(~90% in non-pharma; complete removal in pharma) even without
identifying entry costs, but it remains a bound, not a free-entry
counterfactual. The 10% margin is the cleanest design benchmark; the
diminishing-returns curve and the preference level at which non-SMEs
start dropping out is in the optimal-preference search.

## Follow-ups

- Optimal-preference search
  (`v7-jpube-tight/scripts/61_optimal_preference.R`) over margins
  $\in \{0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%\}$: deserves its own AN page
  to expose the design frontier.
- Distributional incidence
  (`v7-jpube-tight/scripts/60_distributional_incidence.R`): is the SME
  win-rate gain spread across SME firm sizes, or concentrated on
  marginal firms barely above the SME threshold? Important for
  evaluating the preference against alternative SME-support
  instruments.
- Entry-elastic preference benchmark: a version where preference shifts
  firms' decision to participate. The entry-response *bound* (§6.4,
  Online Appendix OA-E) already shows the $V_3 \succ V_0$ ranking
  survives ~90% non-SME discouragement in non-pharma (complete removal
  in pharma); a full free-entry counterfactual that *identifies* entry
  costs remains out of scope for this paper.
