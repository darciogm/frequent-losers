# AN-007: Quantile DiD across the conditional price distribution

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    The average price effect hides where the action is. Open competition cuts prices most at the cheap end of the distribution, where competitive bidders bunch, and even reverses sign at the very top. The gain from competition is concentrated in the bulk of ordinary contracts, not spread evenly.

!!! info "Reduced-form motivation layer"
    The numbers below are from the v1–v4 reduced-form DiDiR pipeline
    (`scripts/02_analysis.R` + companions), which the v8 manuscript
    carries as **motivation** in §1 but does not headline. The canonical
    v8 result is the structural counterfactual decomposition — see
    [AN-010](an-010-bne-decomposition.md) (decomposition) and
    [AN-011](an-011-welfare-arithmetic.md) (welfare arithmetic).

## Question

The DiDiR mean coefficient in [AN-001](an-001-didir-prices.md) is an
average effect across the conditional price distribution. How does the
open-competition price effect vary along the distribution? Canay (2011)
quantile DiD estimates the treatment effect at specified quantiles.

## Design

- **Sample**: same as [AN-001](an-001-didir-prices.md); 18-month window;
  completed items.
- **Specification**: Canay (2011) quantile DiD applied to log prices at
  $\tau \in \{0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90\}$.
- **Outcomes**: conditional quantiles of log prices.

## Results

| $\tau$ | β | SE | p |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.10 | −0.623 | 0.028 | <0.01 |
| 0.25 | −0.543 | 0.023 | <0.01 |
| 0.50 | −0.356 | 0.024 | <0.01 |
| 0.75 | +0.031 | 0.032 | n.s. |
| 0.90 | +0.445 | 0.045 | <0.01 |
| OLS benchmark | −0.124 | 0.017 | <0.01 |

*Coefficients across the conditional price distribution: strongly
negative at low quantiles, reversing at the upper tail.*

Output: `output/tables/tab_quantile_did.tex`,
`output/figures/fig_14_quantile_did.pdf`.

## Interpretation

The benefits of open competition concentrate at the lower quantiles of
the conditional price distribution: $\tau \leq 0.50$ shows strongly
negative coefficients. At $\tau = 0.90$, the effect *reverses* to
positive — possibly reflecting specialized items with thin supplier
markets where opening the auction up admits a price-raising selection
of non-SMEs (e.g., specialized medical equipment from a small pool of
qualified suppliers).

The OLS benchmark (−0.124) sits between the median quantile DiD
(−0.356) and the $\tau = 0.75$ coefficient (+0.031), illustrating that
the mean coefficient is *not* a clean summary of the distributional
impact.

Confidence: **yellow.** The distributional reading is informative but
the standard errors are larger than for the mean coefficient. The
direction at the lower quantiles is robust; the reversal at $\tau =
0.90$ is the most-interesting and most-uncertain finding.

## Follow-ups

- Item-class decomposition of the upper-tail reversal: which item
  subcategories drive the positive coefficient at $\tau = 0.90$?
  Specialized medical equipment vs reagents vs disposables.
- A Frandsen-Lalive-Reinhold conditional-quantile decomposition could
  isolate composition effects (different items being completed in
  pre- vs post-period) from genuine distributional shifts in price
  formation.
