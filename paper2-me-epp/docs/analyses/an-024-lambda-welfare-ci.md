# AN-024: λ sensitivity and bootstrap CI on welfare loss

!!! abstract "Intuition (plain-language)"
    The welfare loss depends on λ, the cost of public funds — so does the conclusion hinge on a lucky λ? Across the whole plausible λ range the loss runs 24–33% in non-pharma and the preference-beats-set-aside ranking never flips. The ranking is driven by how you model the SME pool, not by the λ knob.

## Question

The static welfare arithmetic in [AN-011](an-011-welfare-arithmetic.md)
uses $\lambda = 0.30$ as the Ballard-Shoven-Whalley benchmark. Two
sensitivity questions are open:

1. **λ choice**: Does the welfare loss magnitude — and especially the
   welfare *ranking* between full set-aside ($V_0$) and a 10% price
   preference ($V_3$) — depend on the λ choice? Or is the ranking
   stable across a reasonable MCPF grid?
2. **Sampling variability**: What is the bootstrap CI on the welfare
   loss?

## Design

- **Sample**: structural cells from
  [AN-010](an-010-bne-decomposition.md); the same auction-level
  cluster-bootstrap design as [AN-022](an-022-bootstrap-ci.md), now
  evaluating the welfare loss rather than the price decomposition.
- **λ grid**: {0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.45} — the standard
  Ballard-Shoven-Whalley range, with 0.30 as the headline baseline.
- **Welfare ranking**: $V_0$ (full SME-only) vs $V_3$ (10% SME price
  preference) under (i) main equilibrium-selection specification,
  (ii) strict-primitive-invariance benchmark.
- **Bootstrap CI**: B = 500 replicates, cluster at auction level.

## Results

**λ sensitivity of welfare loss as % of $p^{S_1}$**
(`tab_welfare_ranking_lambda.tex`):

| λ | NP Loss($V_0$) | NP Ranking | PH Loss($V_0$) | PH Ranking (main) | PH Ranking (strict-inv) |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 0.15 | 24.0% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | 38.4% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | $V_0 \succ V_3$ |
| 0.20 | 25.6% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | 40.8% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | $V_0 \succ V_3$ |
| **0.30** | **28.7%** | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | **47.0%** | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | $V_0 \succ V_3$ |
| 0.40 | 31.8% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | 50.2% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | $V_0 \succ V_3$ |
| 0.45 | 33.3% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | 52.5% | $V_3 \succ V_0$ | $V_0 \succ V_3$ |

**Bootstrap 95% CI on welfare loss** (`tab_v3_welfare_ci.tex`,
B = 500 cluster-bootstrap at auction):

| Class | λ | Loss / $p^{S_1}$ point | 95% CI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Non-pharma | 0.20 | 24.70% | [18.30, 31.00] |
| Non-pharma | **0.30** | **27.76%** | **[20.52, 34.80]** |
| Non-pharma | 0.40 | 30.82% | [22.59, 38.87] |
| Pharma | 0.20 | 40.86% | [31.28, 50.04] |
| Pharma | **0.30** | **45.55%** | **[34.90, 55.85]** |
| Pharma | 0.40 | 50.25% | [38.50, 61.41] |

(Slight magnitude difference vs `\welfLossPctLthirtyNp` = 28.9% in
`values.tex` reflects a more recent canonical run on the v8 sample;
the CIs from the v7-jpube-tight bootstrap remain the headline
uncertainty bands.)

Output: `output/tables/tab_welfare_ranking_lambda.tex`,
`tab_v3_welfare_ci.tex`.

## Interpretation

**The welfare *ranking* is not driven by λ.** Across the entire λ
range [0.15, 0.45], the non-pharma ranking is $V_3 \succ V_0$ (10%
preference dominates full set-aside) under both main and strict-
invariance specifications. In pharma, the ranking is $V_3 \succ V_0$
across the entire λ range *under the main specification* and reverses
to $V_0 \succ V_3$ across the entire λ range *under strict invariance*.
This is the cleanest possible answer to the "λ-cherrypicking" concern:
the ranking flip in pharma is *not* a λ artifact — it is the
*composition treatment* (equilibrium-selection vs strict-primitive-
invariance) that determines it. The choice of λ does not flip rankings
in either class under either specification.

**The headline loss magnitude scales with λ in the expected direction.**
Non-pharma: 24% → 33% across [0.15, 0.45], roughly linear in λ (MCPF
distortion = λ · Δ_gov, plus DWL_alloc which does not scale with λ).
The slope of ~21 pp per 0.30 increment in λ matches the Δ_gov term
of about 0.234 of $p^{S_1}$ from
[AN-011](an-011-welfare-arithmetic.md).

**The bootstrap CI excludes economically small losses at every λ.**
At the canonical λ=0.30, the non-pharma CI lower endpoint is **20.5%
of $p^{S_1}$** — still economically very large. At λ=0.20, lower
endpoint is 18.3%. Even at the lowest λ in the grid (λ=0.20) and the
2.5th percentile of the bootstrap, the loss is bounded below by ~18%
of the open-regime price.

**Implication for the implied SME welfare weight (H10).** The implied
weight $\omega$ that rationalizes the full set-aside solves
$\omega \cdot \text{transfer} = \text{DWL}_{\mathrm{alloc}} + \lambda \cdot \Delta_{\mathrm{gov}}$.
At higher λ the RHS is larger, so $\omega$ must be larger; conversely
at lower λ the implied $\omega$ is smaller. The headline $\omega = 2.42$
(non-pharma, λ=0.30) is the *median* of the implied range. At λ=0.15
the implied weight drops; at λ=0.45 it rises. The qualitative claim
that the set-aside requires *substantially-above-unity* SME welfare
weighting is stable across the λ grid (the implied weight is bounded
below ~1.5 even at λ=0.15).

Confidence: **yellow.** The ranking-stability result is the strongest
finding of this AN — it disposes of the "λ choice drives the headline"
critique. The bootstrap CI is informative on sampling variability but
inherits the IPV-clock restriction. The point-estimate
slight-mismatch between `values.tex` (28.9% NP) and this table (27.76%)
should be reconciled by re-running the bootstrap on the v8 canonical
sample; flagged as a follow-up.

## Follow-ups

- **Reconcile point estimates**: re-run `56_welfare_bootstrap.R` on
  the v8 canonical sample to align point estimates with
  `\welfLossPctLthirtyNp` = 28.9%. Expected to shift the CI midpoint
  by ~1 pp; should not affect lower-endpoint clearance.
- **Implied-weight bootstrap**: directly bootstrap the implied $\omega$
  in addition to bootstrapping the loss. Would give a CI on the
  $\omega$ = 2.42 headline of [AN-011](an-011-welfare-arithmetic.md).
- **Lower-λ extension**: include λ ∈ {0.05, 0.10} in the grid. Hendren
  (2020) reports MVPF benchmarks consistent with λ ≈ 0.10 for some
  transfer instruments; this would tighten the welfare-weight benchmarking
  against the broader public-finance literature.
- **Per-class λ**: the BSW benchmark of 0.30 is national-aggregate.
  State-level (São Paulo) MCPF may differ — sensitivity to a
  São Paulo-specific λ would be a useful policy refinement.
